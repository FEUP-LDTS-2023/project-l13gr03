## LDTS_1303 - Pixelated Entities Tactical Showdown [P.E.T.S]

Welcome to the dazzling realm of Pixelated Entities Tactical Showdown (PETS), a riveting turn-based battle game that pits players against each other in an epic clash of strategic prowess. In this pixelated universe, you have the power to assemble a team of three extraordinary PETS, each belonging to one of seven unique types: AquaticAlly, BiomorphicBeast, CelestialGuardian, CyberneticCompanion, LavaLurker, StoneGolem, and ShadowSpecters.

Dive into the awe-inspiring world of PETS, where your tactical decisions will determine the outcome of intense battles. Each Pet boasts a distinct design, a captivating name, and a set of powerful moves, ranging from physical and special attacks to cunning status-inflicting maneuvers. Unleash the full potential of your team and outsmart your opponents with a combination of brute force, strategic planning, and a touch of elemental mastery.

The AquaticAlly, gracefully navigating water-themed attacks, can flood the battlefield with its watery might. The BiomorphicBeast, a creature of adaptability, morphs and manipulates its form to confound foes. The CelestialGuardian, with celestial energy at its disposal, bestows divine buffs upon its allies while smiting enemies with holy wrath. The CyberneticCompanion, a fusion of technology and loyalty, utilizes advanced gadgets to control the flow of battle. The LavaLurker, a fiery force from the depths, engulfs adversaries with molten fury. The StoneGolem, an unyielding colossus, relies on rugged defense and earth-shaking blows. Lastly, the elusive ShadowSpecters harness the power of darkness, weaving in and out of the shadows to confound and strike at will.

Beyond their diverse move sets, each type of PETS possesses unique abilities tied to their elemental nature. Whether it's a defensive buff, a critical hit bonus, or a status ailment immunity, these abilities add an extra layer of strategy to your team-building and battle tactics.

Engage in thrilling battles, challenge friends, and climb the ranks to become the ultimate PETS champion. Choose your team wisely, master the strengths and weaknesses of each type, and embark on an adventure where pixelated entities come to life in a tactical showdown like never before! Are you ready to unleash the power of your PETS?

This project was developed by Afonso Mansilha (up20220****@up.pt), Eduardo Cruz (up20220****@up.pt) e Rodrigo de Sousa (up202205751@up.pt) for LDTS 2023⁄24.

### IMPLEMENTED FEATURES

- **Choose Your Own Team** - Each Player can create their dream Team by picking their favourites from the great Pet selection.
- **Startegy is Key** - Different Pets will have their unique traits which can decide the outcome of the battle, attacks giving twice the damage or even abilities.
- **Alone or With Friends** - The Battles can be fought agaisnt Friends in a PVP Battle or Practice against CPU.

### PLANNED FEATURES

> This section is similar to the previous one but should list the features that are not yet implemented. Instead of screenshots you should include GUI mock-ups for the planned features.

### DESIGN

> This section should be organized in different subsections, each describing a different design problem that you had to solve during the project. Each subsection should be organized in four different parts:

- **Problem in Context.** The description of the design context and the concrete problem that motivated the instantiation of the pattern. Someone else other than the original developer should be able to read and understand all the motivations for the decisions made. When refering to the implementation before the pattern was applied, don’t forget to [link to the relevant lines of code](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-permanent-link-to-a-code-snippet) in the appropriate version.
- **The Pattern.** Identify the design pattern to be applied, why it was selected and how it is a good fit considering the existing design context and the problem at hand.
- **Implementation.** Show how the pattern roles, operations and associations were mapped to the concrete design classes. Illustrate it with a UML class diagram, and refer to the corresponding source code with links to the relevant lines (these should be [relative links](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-readmes#relative-links-and-image-paths-in-readme-files). When doing this, always point to the latest version of the code.
- **Consequences.** Benefits and liabilities of the design after the pattern instantiation, eventually comparing these consequences with those of alternative solutions.

#### KNOWN CODE SMELLS

> This section should describe 3 to 5 different code smells that you have identified in your current implementation.

### TESTING
